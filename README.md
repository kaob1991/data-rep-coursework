# data-rep-coursework
This repository contains coursework as part of the Data Represntation module at ATU. 

There are 3 seperate assignments

## Books.xml 


Exercise 1.1
Create an XML file that stores data for a library (You can create this manually, I am not asking you to create a program to do this). 

The library has two catalogues (technical books, and for cookery books).

Each catalogue can contain a number of books (say 2 for the purpose of this exercise) . 

Books will have an ISBN, title and author.


## assignment03-cso.py


Write a program that retrieves the dataset for the "exchequer account (historical series)" from the CSO, and stores it into a file called "cso.json"

Upload this program to the same repository you used for the XML assignment

Save this assignment as "assignment03-cso.py"

This program should not be a long one

I don't need you to reformat or analyse the data in any way

It should be about 10ish lines long (I have not counted)

You will need to find the dataset in CSO.ie, try economic and then finance.



## assignment04-github.py



Write a program in python that will read a file from a repository, 

The program should then replace all the instances of the text "Andrew" with your name

The program should then commit those changes and push the file back to the repository.

I do not need to see your keys

(see lab2, to follow)

Handup: Save the program as assignment04-github.py to the same repository you uploaded the xml to
